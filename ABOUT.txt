PitchMe is a React Native music app that records audio and detects 
the musical pitch/notes being sung or played. Users can record their 
voice or instruments, view the detected notes, and manage their recordings 
with features like playback, title editing, and organization. It's designed 
for musicians, singers, and music students who want to analyze and track
their pitch accuracy.
